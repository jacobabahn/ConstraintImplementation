## Usage
In order to use the spreadsheet and test the constraints, you want to type values into at least two cells and then set a formula for the two cells in another cell. For example,
you can add the value 1 to A1(Top Row, Left Column), the value 2 to A2(Top Row, Middle Column), and then set A3(Top Row, Right Column) to A1+A2. Then, when you press enter, tab, or leave that cell, it will replace the formula with the calculated value of the A1+A2. So, in this example it would be 3.
The supported operators are + - * /
